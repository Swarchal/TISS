Titration-invariant similarity score (TISS)
============================================

Implementation of the method detailed by Perlman *et al* in their 2004 paper
['Multidimensional Drug Profiling by Automated Microscopy'](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/306/5699/1194.long).

Original was released as Matlab code for batch analysis. This is an attempt to re-write the methods in R with more emphasis on interative use, and to make the method easier to apply to multiple use-cases.
